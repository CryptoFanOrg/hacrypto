@deftypefun {ssize_t} {xssl_getdelim} (xssl_t @var{sbuf}, char ** @var{lineptr}, size_t * @var{n}, int @var{delimiter})
@var{sbuf}: -- undescribed --

@var{lineptr}: a pointer.

@var{n}: The size of  @code{lineptr} .

@var{delimiter}: The delimiter to stop reading at.

Read up to (and including) a  @code{delimiter} from &sb into *LINEPTR (and
NUL-terminate it).   @code{lineptr} is a pointer returned from @code{gnutls_malloc()}  
(or @code{NULL} ), pointing to  @code{n} characters of space.  It is realloc'ed as
necessary.  

Only fatal errors are returned by this function.

Returns the number of characters read (not including
the null terminator), or a negative error code on error.
