@deftypefun {ssize_t} {xssl_write} (xssl_t @var{sb}, const void * @var{data}, size_t @var{data_size})
@var{sb}: is a @code{xssl_t}  structure.

@var{data}: contains the data to send

@var{data_size}: is the length of the data

This function is the buffered equivalent of @code{gnutls_record_send()} .
Instead of sending the data immediately the data are buffered
until @code{xssl_queue()}  is called, or if the flag @code{GNUTLS_SBUF_WRITE_FLUSHES} 
is set, until the number of bytes for a full record is reached.

This function must only be used with blocking sockets.

@strong{Returns:} On success, the number of bytes written is returned, otherwise
an error code is returned.

@strong{Since:} 3.1.7
