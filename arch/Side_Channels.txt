IN?

SCA mitigation
(smartcards etc.)
masking, hiding, shuffling, etc.
simple countermeasures simple and cheap
effective ones (high-order…) more sophisticated

OUT

fault, microprobing, RE, etc.
not much to do at the code level
(or too invasive/slow)
most effective countermeasures at HW level

OTHER
