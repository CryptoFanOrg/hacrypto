<i>Permutation-based encryption, authentication and authenticated encryption</i><br>
<a href="http://hyperelliptic.org/DIAC/slides/PermutationDIAC2012.pdf" class="">slides</a>.<br>
In the last few years, Guido Bertoni, Michaël Peeters, Gilles Van Assche and I have proposed modes for encryption, MAC and authenticated encryption based on fixed-width permutations by means of the sponge and duplex constructions. Our permutation-based approach is scalable and suitable for high-end CPUs as well as resource-constrained platforms. The latter is illustrated by the small Keccak instances and the sponge functions Quark, Photon and Spongent, all addressing lightweight applications.<br>

The sponge and duplex constructions split the width b of the permutation in a capacity c and a rate r: b = r + c. They process r bits per call to the permutation and their generic security strength level in unkeyed mode is c/2. A desired security strength level of k bits limits the rate to at most b - 2k. For keyed modes and bounded data complexity, a security strength level above c/2 can be proven. For MAC computation, encryption and even authenticated encryption with a passive adversary, it comes very close to c. This allows increasing the rate to almost b - k. Moreover, for most use cases the requirements on the underlying permutation can be relaxed, allowing to increase the efficiency even further.<br>

Clearly permutation-based constructions are not new. Concrete examples that are older than the sponge construction include the hash functions Snefru, FFT-Hash and SMASH, the Even-Mansour block cipher construction, stream ciphers Salsa and ChaCha and even Pelican-MAC. In my talk I will present our permutation-based approach in this context and will try to convince you that it is quite competitive with block cipher based modes.

<i>Authenticated Encryption in Practice</i><br>
<a href="http://hyperelliptic.org/DIAC/slides/DIAC-mcgrew.pdf" class="">slides.</a><br>
Over the last decade, authenticated encryption has become accepted as
the appropriate way to provide symmetric confidentiality services.  It
has been adopted into many standards, though in many cases it is
currently an option that is not typically exercised.  This talk
reviews issues that have arisen in the use of authenticated encryption
in practice, and considers the role of authenticated encryption in
cryptographic architectures.

<i>The Evolution of Authenticated Encryption</i><br>
<a href="http://hyperelliptic.org/DIAC/slides/sweden-rogaway-ae-2012b.pdf" class="">slides</a><br>
Nowhere has the promise of practice-oriented provable security
been more successful than in the area of authenticated encryption.
In this talk I will look back and and survey how the provable-security approach has led not just to high-assurance blockcipher-based AE schemes, but, also, how it has led to a blossoming of security notions, attacks, design goals, and designs.

On Some Constructions for Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data<br>
<a href="http://hyperelliptic.org/DIAC/slides/palash-DIAC12-talk.pdf" class="">slides</a><br>

Two approaches to achieving authenticated encryption with associated
data (AEAD) will be considered. <br>

The first approach is to use certain block cipher modes of operations
which make a single pass over the message. For this approach, both
tweakable block cipher based constructions and direct constructions
will be described. Both types of constructions yield families of AEAD
functionalities which offer high efficiency along with other desirable
features such as easy reconfigurability.<br>

In the second approach, a stream cipher supporing an initialisation
vector is used in conjunction with a hash function with provably low
differential probabilities.  Several possibilities will be outlined,
both with and without the requirement of authenticating associated
data. This approach gives efficient solutions for stream ciphers which
are either very fast in software or have very low hardware
footprint.<br>

Security of the constructions are derived using the `provable
security' methodology for the single-user setting. Issues related to
security in the multi-user setting will be briefly mentioned.

<li>Title: Stronger Security Guarantees for Authenticated Encryption Schemes<br>

We here refer to recent and upcoming research that is relevant to
Authenticated Encryption (AE) schemes
as used in practice. This research leads directly to novel design
criteria for authenticated encryption schemes.
The first piece of research considers the security of symmetric
encryption in the presence of ciphertext
fragmentation, which is a setting that commonly arises in practice.
Recent attacks have shown that provably
secure AE schemes may become insecure when used in this setting. We
propose a theoretical framework
for the analysis of AE schemes in the presence of ciphertext
fragmentation. This framework enables us to
study the relationship between confidentiality, the ability to hide
boundaries between ciphertexts, and the
resistance of schemes to Denial of Service attacks. It also leads to
new designs for AE schemes. The second
piece of research relates to distinguishable decryption failures. Most
security proofs implicitly assume that
an adversary is unable to distinguish distinct failure events that
occur during the decryption of a ciphertext.
Practice has shown that this assumption is not well justified:
implementations often leak information that
allows an adversary to distinguish among decryption failures, either
through error messages or timing, thereby
opening up avenues of attack. Our upcoming work analyses the security
of AE schemes in the setting where
failure events are distinguishable, providing new models and security
relations for this setting. From this work,
we can extract design criteria which protect implementations against
such error-based side channel attacks.<br><br>

Title: Lightweight AES-Based Authenticated Encryption<br>
Authors: <u>Andrey Bogdanov</u>, Florian Mendel, Francesco Regazzoni and Vincent Rijmen<br>
Affiliations: KU Leuven, Belgium, ALaRI - USI, Switzerland, TU Graz, Austria<br>
In this paper, we propose an Authenticated Lightweight Encryption algorithm coined ALE. The basic operation of ALE is the AES round transformation and the AES-128 key schedule. ALE is an on-line single-pass authenticated encryption algorithm that supports optional associated data. Its security relies on using nonces. 
<br>
We provide an optimized low-area implementation of ALE in ASIC hardware and demonstrate that its area is about 2.5 kGE which is almost two times smaller than that of the lightweight implementations for AES-OCB and ASC-1 using the same lightweight AES engine. At the same time, it is at least 2.5 times more performant than the alternatives by requiring only about 4 AES rounds to both encrypt and authenticate a 128-bit data block.

Title: Hash-CFB<br>

This paper presents a mode of operation for authenticated encryption -- with
  the very unusual property of employing a hash function as the underlying
  primitive, rather than a block cipher, used in  so many authenticated
  encryption modes. This research has been motivated by the challenge to fit
  secure cryptography into constrained devices --~some of these devices have
  to use a hash function, anyway, and the challenge is to avoid the usage of
  an additional block cipher. Beyond that, our mode has some unique security
  features, namely some form of resistance against side-channel attacks, and a
  misuse-resistant and failure-friendly authentication.

Title: Suggestions for Hardware Evaluation of Cryptographic Algorithms<br>

Public competitions to determine new cryptographic standards such as the search for AES, SASC, SHA-3 have been very successful. Many researchers contribute to such competitions to evaluate different aspects of the candidates among others also the performance of hardware and software implementations. While significant effort has been put into hardware evaluations, somehow the result of these studies could not reliable be tabulated, at least not with the same efficiency as it was done for software evaluations. This paper investigates different shortcomings of current hardware evaluations and proposes changes to future calls, so that the results of hardware evaluators can be combined and compared more reliably.

Title: AEGIS: A Fast Authenticated Encryption Algorithm<br>

Authors: <u>Hongjun Wu</u>, Bart Preneel<br>

This paper introduces a dedicated authenticated encryption algorithm AEGIS,
which is efficient for protecting internet packets. AEGIS-128 uses five AES
round functions to process a 16-byte message block (one step); AES-256 uses six
AES round functions. On the Intel Sandy Bridge Core i5 processor, the speeds of
AEGIS-128, AEGIS-256 are around 0.64 cycles/byte (cpb) and 0.71 cpb,
respectively. Our analysis shows that AEGIS offers a very high security level.

This white paper discusses issues, concerns, constraints and
requirements for future authenticated encryption concepts in the context of
space missions and spacecraft in particular. Following an introduction a
brief description of the approach to securing space missions is given. The
two fundamental security problems in protecting space mission operations
affecting the end-to-end radio and data communications between spacecraft and
ground systems are explained. Typical security function implementations in
spacecraft are recalled. Finally, a brief discussion of each of the
identified issues, concerns, constraints and requirements suggested to be
considered for future authenticated encryption is provided.

Title: SipHash: a fast short-input PRF<br>
<a href="http://hyperelliptic.org/DIAC/slides/SipHash.pdf" class="">slides</a><br>
Authors: <u>Jean-Philippe Aumasson</u> and Daniel J. Bernstein<br>

SipHash is a family of pseudorandom functions optimized for short
   inputs. Target applications include network traffic authentication
   and hash-table lookups protected against hash-flooding
   denial-of-service attacks. SipHash is simpler than MACs based on
   universal hashing, and faster on short inputs. Compared to dedicated
   designs for hash-table lookup, SipHash has well-defined security
   goals and competitive performance. For example, SipHash processes a
   16-byte input with a fresh key in 140 cycles on an AMD FX-8150
   processor, which is much faster than state-of-the-art MACs. We
   propose that hash tables switch to SipHash as a hash function.

Title: Heavy Quark for secure AEAD<br>

Lightweight primitives are generally limited to 80- or 128-bit securit
y, because lightweight applications seldom need more than
this. However, non-lig htweight platforms like multimedia
systems-on-chip would also greatly benefit fr om a smaller hardware
footprint, as it reduces development and integration costs , and
leaves more circuit area to another component, or to add another
functiona lity. Such systems sometimes need up to 256-bit security,
for example to ensure a consistent security level across
primitives. This paper thus breaks with the t radition and proposes a
256-bit authenticated encryption scheme with associated data (AEAD),
based on the lightweight design Quark. We create a new Quark instan ce
to use in a custom SpongeWrap mode, offering one-pass AEAD supporting
arbitra ry interleaving of encrypted and associated data, as well as a
range of trade-of fs between security and usage limit. More than a new
primitive, this work provid es insights on the scalability of
lightweight designs to higher security levels: our new design c-Quark
has internal state of 384 bits, and allows the implement ation of
256-bit AEAD with in the order of 4000 GE.<br><br>

EAX' (EAX-prime) is an authenticated encryption (AE) specified by ANSI
C12.22 as a standard security function used for a smart grid. EAX' is
based on EAX, a provably secure AE proposed by Bellare, Rogaway, and
Wagner.<br>
This paper presents simple and efficient forgery attacks, distinguishers,
and message recovery attacks against EAX' using single-block cleartext
and plaintext.

Title: How Fast Can a Two-Pass Mode Go?  A Parallel Deterministic Authenticated Encryption Mode for AES-NI (Extended Abstract of Work in Progress)<br>

Authors: <u>Kazumaro Aoki</u>, Tetsu Iwata, Kan Yasuda<br>
Affiliations: NTT, Nagoya University<br>
We present a mode of operation for deterministic authenticated
encryption. Our design is entirely blockcipher-based, like SIV
from Eurocrypt 2006. Unlike SIV, however, our mode is fully parallelizable,
both in its authentication and encryption parts. The basic idea is
a combination of PMAC for authentication and the CTR mode for encryption.
Our implementation yields 2.047 cpb for Intel's Sandy Bridge
microarchitecture, which contrasts with 2.900 cpb of the GCM mode in
OpenSSL 1.0.1c.

Title: A Do-It-All-Cipher for RFID: Design Requirements (Extended Abstract)<br>
Authors: <u>Markku-Juhani O. Saarinen</u> and Daniel Engels<br>
Affiliations: Revere Security, United States of America<br>
Recent years have seen significant progress in the development of
	lightweight symmetric cryptoprimitives. The main concern of the 
	designers of these primitives has been to minimize the number of 
	gate equivalents (GEs) of the hardware implementation. However, 
	there are numerous additional requirements that are present in 
	real-life RFID systems. We give an overview of requirements 
	emerging or already present in the widely deployed EPCGlobal Gen2 
	and ISO / IEC 18000-63 passive UHF RFID air interface standards. 
	Lightweight stateful authenticated encryption algorithms seem to 
	offer the most complete set of features for this purpose. In this 
	work we give a Gen2-focused "lessons learned" overview of the 
	challenges and related developments in RFID cryptography and
	propose what we see as appropriate design criteria for a cipher 
	(dubbed "Do-It-All-Cipher" or DIAC) for the Internet of Things. 
	We also comment on the applicability of NSA's new SIMON and 
	SPECK proposals for this purpose.<br><br>

Title: An Improved Hardware Implementation of the Grain-128a Stream Cipher<br>
<a href="http://hyperelliptic.org/DIAC/slides/DIACShohrehSharifPdf.pdf" class="">slides</a>. <br>

In this paper we study efficient hardware implementations of the
Grain-128a family of stream ciphers.  To achieve higher throughput compared to
the standard design, we apply four different techniques in combination:
isolation of the authentication section, Fibonacci-to-Galois transformation of
the feedback shift registers, multi-frequency implementation and internal
pipelining. The combined effects of all these techniques, when a two-level
pipeline is used, enable an average 52% increase in throughput among all the
ciphers. All techniques are standard cell techniques and are therefore easy to
apply. They introduce an average 9% area penalty and an average 5% power
overhead.<br><br>
