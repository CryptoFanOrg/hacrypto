<h2>CAESAR call for submissions, draft 1 (2013.04.16)</h2>
<p>
This document is <b>draft 1</b>
of a call for CAESAR public submissions.
Please check
<a href="http://competitions.cr.yp.to">http://competitions.cr.yp.to</a>
for newer drafts.
<h3>Call</h3>
<p>
CAESAR (Competition for Authenticated Encryption: Security, Applicability, and Robustness)
will identify a portfolio of authenticated ciphers
that offer advantages over AES-GCM and that are suitable for widespread adoption.
Cryptographic algorithm designers are invited to submit
public proposals of authenticated ciphers to CAESAR.
<h3>Deadlines</h3>
<p>
First-round submission PDF files must be received
by the caesar-submissions email address
between 2013.12.01 and <b>2014.01.15 23:59 GMT</b>.
This email must have subject line precisely <tt>round 1 submission: NAME</tt>
where <tt>NAME</tt> is replaced by the cipher name.
After 2014.01.15 the CAESAR secretary will publish all first-round submissions received,
except that the CAESAR secretary may exclude submissions that do not meet the requirements below.
<p>
Reference software implementations must be received
by the caesar-submissions email address
between 2013.12.01 and <b>2014.02.15 23:59 GMT</b>.
This email must have subject line precisely <tt>round 1 software: NAME</tt>
where <tt>NAME</tt> is replaced by the cipher name.
<h3>Functional requirements</h3>
<p>
An <b>authenticated cipher</b>
is a function with five byte-string inputs and one byte-string output.
The five inputs are
a variable-length <b>plaintext</b>,
variable-length <b>additional data</b>,
a fixed-length (possibly 0-bit) <b>private message number</b>,
a fixed-length (possibly 0-bit) <b>public message number</b>,
and a fixed-length <b>key</b>.
The output is a variable-length <b>ciphertext</b>.
The first four inputs have different security purposes, as indicated in the following table:
<table border>
<tr><th><p></p></th><th><p>integrity</p></th><th><p>confidentiality</p></th><th><p>may impose single-use requirements</p></th></tr>
<tr><td><p>plaintext</p></td><td><p>yes</p></td><td><p>yes</p></td><td><p>no</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>additional data</p></td><td><p>yes</p></td><td><p>no</p></td><td><p>no</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>private message number</p></td><td><p>yes</p></td><td><p>yes</p></td><td><p>yes</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>public message number</p></td><td><p>yes</p></td><td><p>no</p></td><td><p>yes</p></td></tr>
</table>
It must be possible to recover the plaintext and the private message number
from the ciphertext, additional data, public message number, and key.
<p>
Bytes are integers between 0 and 255 inclusive.
Authenticated ciphers defined in terms of higher-level objects
must specify the relationship between those objects and byte strings:
for example, little-endian encoding of 32-bit integers.
<p>
Submitters are advised that many existing applications use 
80-bit, 128-bit, or 256-bit keys;
96-bit or 104-bit public message numbers;
0-bit private message numbers;
and 32, 64, 96, 128, or 160 extra bits (used for authentication) in ciphertext
compared to plaintext.
However, submissions are not required to support these sizes,
and are not limited to these sizes.
<p>
Each submission specifies a <b>family</b> of authenticated ciphers.
Family members may vary in external parameters such as key length,
and may vary in submission-defined parameters such as the number of "rounds".
However,
a submission is also permitted to specify a family containing just 1 authenticated cipher.
Each submission must include a list of at most 10 recommended parameter sets.
<h3>Software requirements</h3>
<p>
Each first-round submission
must be accompanied by a portable reference software implementation
to support public understanding of the cipher,
cryptanalysis, verification of subsequent implementations, etc.
This implementation must cover all recommended parameter sets.
This implementation is expected to be optimized for clarity, not for performance;
the official CAESAR benchmarks
will report the fastest implementation on each platform,
and will thus disregard the reference implementation
on any platform where it is superseded by faster implementations.
Submissions without working reference software implementations
will not be selected for the second round.
<p>
A minimal reference implementation of (e.g.) AES-128-GCM
consists of two files:
<tt>crypto_aead/aes128gcm/ref/api.h</tt>
and
<tt>crypto_aead/aes128gcm/ref/encrypt.c</tt>.
There are three levels of directory names:
<ul>
<li>
The first-level directory name <tt>crypto_aead</tt>
is the same for all authenticated ciphers.
<li>
The second-level directory name is a lowercase version of the cipher name,
including a specification of the parameter set.
A reference implementation covering 3 different parameter sets
has 3 different second-level directories.
Dashes, dots, slashes, and other punctuation marks are omitted;
the directory name consists solely of digits (0123456789)
and lowercase ASCII letters (abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz).
<li>
The third-level directory name is <tt>ref</tt> for the reference implementation.
Other implementations of the same cipher (with the same parameter set)
use other third-level directory names.
</ul>
<p>
The file api.h has four lines:
<pre>
     #define CRYPTO_KEYBYTES 16
     #define CRYPTO_NPRIVBYTES 0
     #define CRYPTO_NPUBBYTES 12
     #define CRYPTO_ABYTES 16
</pre>
<p>
This indicates that the AES-128-GCM key has 16 bytes,
that the private message number has 0 bytes,
that the public message number has 12 bytes,
and that the ciphertext is <i>at most</i> 16 bytes longer than the plaintext.
(A typical authenticated cipher has a constant gap between plaintext length
and ciphertext length,
but the requirement here is to have a constant <i>limit</i> on the gap.)
<p>
The file encrypt.c has the following structure:
<pre>
     #include "crypto_aead.h"

     int crypto_aead(
       unsigned char *c,unsigned long long *clen,
       const unsigned char *m,unsigned long long mlen,
       const unsigned char *ad,unsigned long long adlen,
       const unsigned char *npriv,
       const unsigned char *npub,
       const unsigned char *k
     )
     {
       ...
       ... the code for the cipher implementation goes here,
       ... generating a ciphertext c[0],c[1],...,c[*clen-1]
       ... from a plaintext m[0],m[1],...,m[mlen-1]
       ... and additional data ad[0],ad[1],...,ad[adlen-1]
       ... and private message number npriv[0],npriv[1],...
       ... and public message number npub[0],npub[1],...
       ... and secret key k[0],k[1],...
       ...
       return 0;
     }

     int crypto_aead_open(
       unsigned char *m,unsigned long long *mlen,
       unsigned char *npriv,
       const unsigned char *c,unsigned long long clen,
       const unsigned char *ad,unsigned long long adlen,
       const unsigned char *npub,
       const unsigned char *k
     )
     {
       ...
       ... the code for the cipher implementation goes here,
       ... generating a plaintext m[0],m[1],...,m[*mlen-1]
       ... and private message number npriv[0],npriv[1],...
       ... from a ciphertext c[0],c[1],...,c[clen-1]
       ... and additional data ad[0],ad[1],...,ad[adlen-1]
       ... and public message number npub[0],npub[1],...
       ... and secret key k[0],k[1],...
       ...
       return 0;
     }
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>crypto_aead_open</tt> function must return -1
if the ciphertext is not valid,
i.e.,
if the ciphertext does not equal the encryption of any (plaintext,private message number) pair
with this additional data, public message number, and secret key.
The <tt>crypto_aead</tt> and <tt>crypto_aead_open</tt>
functions may return other negative numbers
to indicate other failures (e.g., memory-allocation failures).
<p>
The file <tt>crypto_aead.h</tt>
is not included in the reference implementation;
it is created automatically by the benchmarking framework.
<p>
A reference implementation can use names other than <tt>encrypt.c</tt>.
It can split its code across several files <tt>*.c</tt>
defining various auxiliary functions;
the files will be automatically compiled together.
Instead of <tt>encrypt.c</tt> it can include <tt>encrypt.cc</tt> or <tt>encrypt.cpp</tt> in C++.
<p>
The reference implementation is packaged into a tarball,
such as <tt>aes128gcm.tar.gz</tt> for AES-128-GCM.
<h3>Hardware requirements</h3>
<p>
Each submission selected for the second round
will also be required to include a reference hardware design
(i.e., a reference implementation in the VHDL or Verilog languages)
by <b>2015.03.15</b>.
Details of the hardware API have not yet been specified.
<h3>Submission requirements</h3>
<p>
Each submission consists of a single PDF file with the following sections:
<ul>
<li>First page:
Cipher name,
name of designer/designers,
name of submitter/submitters (usually the same as the designer/designers),
one contact email address for submitter/submitters.
The cipher name is required to include a version number (e.g., "v1")
to avoid confusion in case the cipher is tweaked for subsequent rounds of the competition.
<li><b>Specification:</b>
A complete definition of the family of authenticated ciphers.
This definition must include the complete parameter space defining the family,
and must include a list of at most 10 recommended parameter sets.
The cipher definition is required to be self-contained,
including all information necessary to implement the cipher from scratch,
except that the following functions are free to be used without being defined:
AES-128 with 128-bit key, 128-bit input, and 128-bit output;
AES-256 with 256-bit key, 128-bit input, and 128-bit output.
<li><b>Security goals:</b>
A table quantifying, for each of the recommended parameter sets,
the intended number of bits of security
(i.e., the logarithm base 2 of the attack cost)
in each of the following categories:
<ul>
<li>
confidentiality for the plaintext;
<li>
confidentiality for the private message number (omit if the private message number has length 0);
<li>
integrity for the plaintext;
<li>
integrity for the additional data;
<li>
integrity for the private message number (omit if the private message number has length 0);
<li>
integrity for the public message number (omit if the public message number has length 0);
and
<li>
any additional security goals and robustness goals that the submitters wish to point out.
</ul>
This section must clearly state either
<ul>
<li>
that users are required to treat the concatenation of the private message number
and the public message number as a <b>nonce</b>,
i.e., that the cipher may lose all integrity and confidentiality
if the legitimate key holder
uses the same (private message number,public message number) pair
to encrypt two different (plaintext,additional data) pairs under the same key;
or
<li>
that the cipher is designed to provide
the maximum possible robustness against message-number reuse,
i.e., 
that the cipher maintains full integrity and confidentiality,
except for leaking collisions of 
(plaintext,additional data,private message number,public message number)
via collisions of ciphertexts;
or
<li>
that the cipher is designed to provide
some intermediate level of robustness against message-number reuse,
in which case this section must specify what that level of robustness is.
</ul>
This section may also state goals that accommodate variations in attack resources,
such as
software side channels,
hardware side channels,
large numbers of active keys,
large numbers of legitimate messages encrypted,
etc.
<li><b>Security analysis:</b>
An explanation of why the submitter expects this family of ciphers,
with each of the recommended parameter sets,
to meet the stated security goals and robustness goals.
<li><b>Features:</b>
A detailed list of cipher features that the submitter wishes to emphasize,
including explanations of what each feature means and why the feature is of interest.
This section is expected to include discussion
of performance, potential applications, advantages over previous ciphers, etc.
This section must explain, in particular, why users should prefer this cipher over AES-GCM.
<li><b>Design rationale:</b>
An explanation of the choices made in the cipher design.
This section must include an analysis of how a weakness could be hidden in the cipher,
and must include the following statement:
"The designer/designers have not hidden any weaknesses in this cipher."
<li><b>Intellectual property:</b>
Full disclosure of all known patents, patent applications, planned patent applications,
and other intellectual-property constraints
relevant to use of the cipher.
This section must include the following statement:
"If any of this information changes,
the submitter/submitters will promptly (and within at most one month)
announce these changes on the <tt>crypto-competitions</tt> mailing list."
Note that intellectual-property status will be taken into account in cipher evaluation;
patented submissions are permitted,
but submitters are advised
that patenting a cipher is likely to reduce the level of interest in the cipher.
<li><b>Consent:</b>
The following statement:
"The submitter/submitters
hereby consent to all decisions of the CAESAR selection committee
regarding the selection or non-selection of this submission
as a second-round candidate, a third-round candidate, a finalist, a member of the final portfolio,
or any other designation provided by the committee.
The submitter/submitters
understand that the committee will not comment on the algorithms,
except that for each selected algorithm
the committee will simply cite the previously published analyses
that led to the selection of the algorithm.
The submitter/submitters
understand that the selection of some algorithms
is not a negative comment regarding other algorithms,
and that an excellent algorithm might fail to be selected
simply because not enough analysis was available at the time of the committee decision.
The submitter/submitters
acknowledge that the committee decisions
reflect the collective expert judgments of the committee members
and are not subject to appeal.
The submitter/submitters
understand that if they disagree with published analyses
then they are expected to promptly and publicly respond to those analyses,
not to wait for subsequent committee decisions.
The submitter/submitters
understand that this statement is required as a condition
of consideration of this submission by the CAESAR selection committee."
