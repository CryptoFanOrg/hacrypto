Dear all

as  required by CAESAR rules, hereby I notify that I have formally withdrawn
all the patent claims covering all the ++æ variants so far published either
offically as CAESAR candidates (i.e. versions 1.1 and 1.2) or in my blog as
v2.0 candidates (http://inputoutputblockchaining.blogspot.com). Moreover, to
the knowledge of the author, no one of them is covered by any other IPR
restriction. Thus, anyone willing to further develop any of them, or to use, is
free to do so (and welcome).

Cheers!
