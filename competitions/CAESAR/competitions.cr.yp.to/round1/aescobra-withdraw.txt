Dear all,

Many thanks to Mridul Nandi for looking into COBRA and for finding this clever
attack.

In the meantime, we found a solution, at the cost of efficiency, to this subtle
oversight in COBRA and its proof. Nevertheless, we think it is fair to withdraw
COBRA from the competition.

Best regards,
The COBRA team.
