 As requested by the CAESAR secretary, this note is to concretize
 the security goals for AEZ parameter set "aez".

 The basic security goal for aez is that an adversary can't be
 exhibited that violates confidentiality or integrity with
 advantage exceeding

   22 s^2 / 2^128  +  max(t/2^128, 2^-61)

 where s is the total number of 16-byte blocks of messages
 encrypted-or-authenticated (plus 3 blocks per message, by
 convention) and t is the time (including the description size)
 in which the adversary runs.  (a) When we speak here of violating
 confidentiality or integrity we mean the MRAE (misuse-resistant AE)
 notion of Rogaway-Shrimpton-2004.  (b) The second addend in the
 formula above is just a stand-in for an advantage term associated
 to breaking the strong-PRP property for AES.  The value has been
 increased over the more naive t/2^128 value to account for
 low-advantage distinguishing attacks on AES (see
 [Bernstein and Lange, AC13]) that can be adapted to AEZ and
 other AE schemes.  (c) The constants 22 and 3 are sufficient
 for our security bounds for AEZ+.  We heuristically assume
 that these same bounds hold for AEZ itself.  (d) The number
 of encryption and decryption queries does not appear in
 the formula above because, for simplicity, we have folded
 them into 's'.
