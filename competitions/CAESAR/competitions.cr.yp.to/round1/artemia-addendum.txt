Dear All,
  As commented by the secretary of CEASAR, we updated the following sections of
the Artemia  document:

1) Security Goals: we clarify the maximum length of a queried message or
associated data to be $2^64-1$ and $2^24-1$ respectively.

2)Features: where we compare Artemia and GCM-AES as follows:
AES-GCM is a block cipher based design while Artemia is a dedicated design.
AES-GCM is a two-pass AE but Artemia is a single-pass one. Artemia does not
contain  key schedule and it  does not use field multiplication. Artemia uses 
MDS recursive layers that can be easily implemented in both  software and
hardware. Hence we expect that Artemia provides a good performance in software
and hardware.  
Artemia-512 provides 128-bit integrity of the plaintext, associated data and
nonce which is greater than the bounds provided by AES-GCM. The main
disadvantage of Artemia is that it is serial.

3)Design Rationale: partially updated as follows :
Artemia has two main components: the JHAE mode and the permutation $Artemia$.
In order to design each component, we use the publicly known elements to avoid
any hidden weaknesses inside those components. In addition, the designers state
that they have not hidden any weaknesses in this scheme.

4)Intellectual Property: It has been updated as follows:
Artemia itself is not covered by any patent and it is freely-available. On the
other hand, as a building block, it uses the JH hash mode which is not covered
by any patent as far as the designers of Artemia know but if there is any
patent for JH then it would be applicable to the mode which is used in Artemia.
If any of this information changes, the submitter will promptly (and within at
most one month) announce these changes on the crypto-competitions mailing list.

PS
1
: the revised version is attached to this email for more clarification which is
named Artemia v.1.1 .

PS2: we also updated the padding approach, as we were announced in this mailing
list already (section 1.4.1: Encryption and Authentication).


Thanks and regards,
Artemia-Team (Javad, Mohammad Reza, Nasour)
