Hi all,

We forgot to put in our submission file for KIASU, Joltik and Deoxys that no
backdoor was put inside the schemes. Although we wish to know how to do that,
we emphasize that "The designer/designers have not hidden any weaknesses in
this cipher".

Also, we forgot to precise the priority regarding the recommanded parameter
sets for Joltik and Deoxys. They are actually displayed in the table from most
important to least important.

Regards,

Ivica, Jeremy, Thomas.
