Dear all,
I'm withdrawing McMambo formally: apparently saying "it's dead" isn't enough.
The reason is a large differential probability that produces a forgery. This
got noticed virtually immediately, but my reply seems to have got lost in the
shuffle.

Don't use McMambo. Don't make McMambo part of the CAESER portfolio. If anyone
mentions McMambo as a good idea, point them at this post.

Sincerely,
Watson Ladd
