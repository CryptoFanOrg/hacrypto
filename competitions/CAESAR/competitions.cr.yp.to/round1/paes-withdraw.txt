Dear all,

We withdraw two schemes PAES & PANDA submitted to the CAESAR competition.

PAES & PANDA have deviated far from our original vision of design due to their
fragile structures. Many thanks to J ́er ́emy Jean, Ivica Nikoli ́c, Yu Sasaki,
Lei Wang, Xiutao Feng, Fan Zhang, Hui Wang and Han Sui for their insightful
observations and ingenious attacks, and all who were ever concerned about our
schemes.

Best regards,

The PAES & PANDA team
