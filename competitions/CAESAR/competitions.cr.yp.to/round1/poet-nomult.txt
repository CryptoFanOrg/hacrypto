Dear all,

thanks to Mohamed Ahmed Abdelraheem, Andrey Bogdanov and Elmar
Tischhauser, who applied the observations of Cid and Procter to POET
and thus, concretized the risk of weak keys when using a
multiplication in GF(2^{128}) for hashing. Thanks also for the
comments by Markku Saarinen on the mailing list.

When we designed POET, we started with two variants using 4-round AES
and full-AES as a universal hash function. We considered it
interesting to amend these two with a third variant using Galois-Field
multiplication for the same purpose, but we failed to properly
research the risk of weak keys for that case. As it turned out, the
weak key probability is too high to use that variant of POET with any
comfort.

Therefore, we withdraw the POET variant with Galois-Field
multiplications. We maintain our support for the variants with 4-round
AES and full AES.

An updated version of POET (1.2) can be found at

Best Regards,

The POET Team
