Dear all,

First, we would like to thank Wang Lei and Sim Siang Meng for pointing out a
mistake in the padding rule of SCREAM/iSCREAM (see their post “Forgery Attack
on SCREAM and iSCREAM”).

We also found another simple forgery attack for any message M||P, where P is
the final block (full or partial). Given the authenticated encryption of the
message M||[0]||P, one can build a valid encryption of M||P by removing the
ciphertext corresponding to the zero block, and copying the tag.

In both cases, the weaknesses come from modificactions of TAE that were aimed
to allow longer messages. We have revised our mode to address this problem.
SCREAMv2 and iSCREAMv2 are now based on the original TAE mode. If possible, we
would like these versions to be considered in the future.

An update from SCREAMv1/iSCREAMv1 to SCREAMv2/iSCREAMv2 is available here:

and the full description of SCREAMv2/iSCREAMv2 is available there:
http://perso.uclouvain.be/fstandae/SCREAM/SCREAM_v2.pdf

In addition, we would like to take this opportunity to specify an ordering of
the recommended parameters, as required by the CAESAR secretary.  We suggest
the following order:
1. SCREAM with 10 steps (aiming for single-key security)
2. iSCREAM with 12 steps (aiming for single-key security)
3. SCREAM with 12 steps (aiming for related-key security)
4. iSCREAM with 14 steps, (aiming for related-key security)

Best regards,
