I would like to withdraw Calico from the competition.

The new job is pretty demanding, and it turns out that I don't have the time to
work on a good implementation for Calico anymore.  I haven't had a chance to
commit any code to any github projects since I started at Oculus.  12 hour day,
weekends, etc etc.  To get any hobby projects done, it seems prudent to prune a
few..

Thanks for giving me the opportunity to work on this software! :)

Best,
Chris
