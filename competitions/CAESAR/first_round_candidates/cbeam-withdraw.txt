Hi,

Brice Minaud reports that the CBEAM Pi permutation is vulnerable to a
very simple attack, which I believe to be valid. I can't believe that
I missed that -- this is the flipside of running a one-man team, being
blind to the obvious..

However I am leaving more detailed reporting to Brice, just in case he
wants to keep some details back and prepare a publication based on
this (CBEAM Pi was published in CT-RSA this year, after all).

I thank Brice for his effort and I hereby withdraw CBEAM from the
CAESAR competition. The cbeam.mx site has been updated to reflect
this.

STRIBOB is still in there, though! the attack has nothing to do with
the BLNK mode, which is the only thing that these two submissions
share.

Cheers,
- markku
