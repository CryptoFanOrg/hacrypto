Dear CEASAR community,

Thanks Jiqiang ! Indeed Thomas, GaÃ«tan, and Valentin contacted me few days ago
that a slightly modified attack would still work.

Although birthday bound security, i.e., 2^n/2 time and data/query is still
among the highest security level under the nonce reuse and decryption-misuse
scenarios, and further (simple) tweak is still possible to resist this attack,
Marble failed its design goals here as an attempt to achieve the security level
of 2^n time and data .

To be fair with other CEASAR designers, I would withdraw Marble from the
competition.

Regards,
Jian.
