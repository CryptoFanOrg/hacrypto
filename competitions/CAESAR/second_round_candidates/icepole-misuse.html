Subject: Nonce reuse in ICEPOLE

Very recently Huang, Wu, and Tjuawinata published an analysis on ICEPOLE in the
scenario where all nonce-like mechanisms are violated, namely nonce itself is
reused, secret message number is reused (or not present), associated data are
the same (for chosen messages). In such special case, as shown in their
analysis, ICEPOLE can not offer "intermediate robustness" as stated in
the documentaton. 

Since it is not clear whether a user should respect SMN, or in what way the
claims refer to the SMN, we want to give the following clarification. In the
case of nonce misuse, the intermediate level of robustness (specified in the
documentation) holds only when the SMN is present and respected, namely each
message has the corresponding, unique secret message number.
