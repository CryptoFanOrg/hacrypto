Dear all,

as requested by the CAESAR secretary, we have clarified the ordering
of the POET variants, and we revised the consent (in the original
submission, we had written "we" where we should have written "the
submitters"). With some additional modifications (see the changelog at
page iii), the revised paper can be downloaded from the POET web site:

  <http://www.uni-weimar.de/de/medien/professuren/mediensicherheit/research/poet/>


Ordering:

  1. POET with 4-round AES
  2. POET with Galois-Field multiplications in $GF(2^{128})$
  3. POET with full-round AES

Consent

The submitters hereby consent to all decisions of the CAESAR selection
committee regarding the selection or non-selection of this submission
as a second-round candidate, a third-round candidate, a finalist, a
member of the final portfolio, or any other designation provided by
the committee. The submitters understand that the committee will not
comment on the algorithms, except that for each selected algorithm the
committee will simply cite the previously published analyses that led
to the selection of the algorithm. The submitters understand that the
selection of some algorithms is not a negative comment regarding other
algorithms, and that an excellent algorithm might fail to be selected
simply because not enough analysis was available at the time of the
committee decision. The submitters acknowledge that the committee
decisions reflect the collective expert judgments of the committee
members and are not subject to appeal. The submitters understand that
if they disagree with published analyses then they are expected to
promptly and publicly respond to those analyses, not to wait for
subsequent committee decisions. The submitters understand that this
statement is required as a condition of consideration of this
submission by the CAESAR selection committee.
