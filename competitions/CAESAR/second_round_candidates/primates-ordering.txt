Dear all,

As requested by the CAESAR secretary, by this e-mail we clarify the
ordering of PRIMATEs:
1. APE-15
2. HANUMAN-15
3. GIBBON-15
4. APE-10
5. HANUMAN-10
6. GIBBON-10
We note, though, that the different primates serve different security
goals (e.g., APE is robust even when the nonce is misused, whereas
HANUMAN and GIBBON require uniqueness of the nonce). In an upcoming
new version of the submission document, we will elaborate further on
this choice.

Best regards,
The PRIMATEs team.
