According to security requirements (part 4.A iii) of the hash functions NIST
expects the SHA-3 algorithm should be resistent to length-extension attacks.

Definition of length-extension attack: Given h(m) and length(m) but not m, the
attacker easily creates m' (with correct padding) and calculates h(m || m')
simply from h(m) and m'.

In the specification document of CRUNCH (Page 9), you stated that the last
chaining value is the message digest. Since there is no final output
transformation and the last chaining value is the message digest, CRUNCH is
trivially vulnerable to length-extension attacks.
