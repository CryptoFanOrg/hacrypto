--------------------------------------------

Dynamic SHA is vulnerable to generic attacks.

According to security requirements (part 4.A iii) of the hash functions
NIST expects the SHA-3 algorithm should be resistent to length-extension
attacks.

Length-extension attack is not correctly understood and described in
paragraph 6.1 of submitted Dynamic SHA documentations.

As a consequence, Dynamic SHA (with 256-bit and 512-bit outputs) function
(h) is trivially vulnerable to length-extension attacks. Given h(m)
and len(m) but not m, the attacker easily creates m' (with correct padding)
and calculates h (m || m') simply from h(m) and m'.

Moreover, in the function's design there are no precautions against other
generic attacks (multi-collisions etc.).
