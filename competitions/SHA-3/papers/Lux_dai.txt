Dear all,

I looked at Wu et. al's report [1] on LUX and I believe that
their observation can obviously be extended to a collision
attack and a second preimage attack which would be labeled
orange in the SHA-3 zoo according to their computational
complexities.
The following is the brief sketch of the attacks.


==  Wu et. al's observation

Let H=(h0, h1, ..., h7) be the hash value and
hi=(ai, bi, ci, di) be its byte expression.
Then the following relation holds for 0<i<8.
0xf7*ai + 0x4c*bi + 0xf4*ci + di = 0x4e * S(a(i-1))......(1)
See [1] Section 3.1 for more detail.


== What does it mean?

Eq.(1) means that 4 bytes of hi of the output determine
1 byte of h(i-1).
In other words, LUX-256 has undesirable property that
the 56(=8*7) bits of the output are determined by
the remaining 256-56=200 bits without extra computational
cost.
It obviously reduces the complexity of the birthday attack
and the second preimage attack.


== Collision attack and second preimage attack

Find a partial collision such that
bi=bi',ci=ci',di=di' for 0<=i<8 and a7=a7'.
With help of Eq.(1) and the fact that S is a permutation,
we have ai=ai' for 0<=i<7.

=== Complexity of collision attack
* Hash function call: 2^{(3*8+1)*8/2} = 2100.
* Memory: 2100.

=== Complexity of second preimage attack
* Hash function call: 2200,
* Memory: none.


== LUX-512

LUX-512 has the same weakness as LUX-256 so that the 56(=8*7) bits
of the output are determined by the remaining 512-56=456 bits.
In the similar manner to the attacks on LUX-256, the collision
attack and the second preimage attack require 2^{456/2}=2228
and 2456 complexity respectively.
