Since the release of OpenSSL 1.0.1a a couple of significant problems have
become apparent.

1. Compilation on non x86 and x86_64 platforms fails in the file
   e_rc4_hmac_md5.c

2. Attempts to use ciphers in FIPS capable builds outside FIPS mode fails.

A release of OpenSSL 1.0.1b will be made in the near future to address this
and any other reported problems.

Anyone not wishing to wait should use the most recent 1.0.1-stable snapshot
from ftp://ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/
