The sources were compiled and executed with Microsoft Visual Studio 
2005 Standard Edition (version 8.0.50727.42) under Windows XP x64 Edition.
The implementation encrypts 4 bocks of input data in parallel, so
all tick-measures refer to the encryption of 4 blocks.
A typical output on an AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 146
with 2.00 GHz and 1 GB of RAM would look as following:

aes_bitsliced:
