The folders 'aes_bitsliced' and 'aes_bitsliced_fast' contain
Microsoft Visual Studio projects for a bitslice implementation 
of the AES with 128-bit keys on processors with 
x64-architecture processing 4 blocks of input data in parallel.
Only the encryption is implemented. The implementation is
done in C and in Microsoft Assembler (MASM) Syntax.
The sources were compiled and executed with Microsoft Visual Studio 
2005 Standard Edition (version 8.0.50727.42) under Windows XP x64 Edition.
'aes_bitsliced_fast' contains some optimization on instruction
level and is thus harder to understand than 'aes_bitsliced_fast'
